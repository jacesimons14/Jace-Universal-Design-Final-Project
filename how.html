        <h2>How to achieve it</h2>
        <p>Now that we know what Universal Design is and why it's important, let's look at how to achieve it!</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="code-card">
                <h3>1. Semantic HTML</h3>
                <p>Use the right tag for the job. Buttons for actions, links for travel.</p>
                <code>&lt;button&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
                <p>Using modern semantic html tags makes it easier for screen readers and assistive tech to understand the
                    content of a website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="code-card">
                <h3>2. Responsive Layouts</h3>
                <p>Design mobile-first. Let content flow naturally.</p>
                <code>@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }</code>
                <p>Responsive layouts ensure that your website works on all devices, from desktop to mobile. Do this by designing the website & content to be viewed on a phone primarily, so that extra space available on the desktop becomes a bonus to fit more information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="code-card">
                <h3>3. Color & Contrast</h3>
                <p>Ensure text is readable for everyone. People with color blindness or partial blindness have a hard time reading not-well-contrasting words on the screen. If the background is dark and the text is too, it makes it unreadable to a lot of people. Do this by using good contrast between background and text, and making sure the font is readable improve the experience for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="code-card">
                <h3>4. Keyboard Nav</h3>
                <p>A lot of people use the keyboard to navigate web pages, by pressing tab to jump around and enter to select things. If your website is not keyboard-navigable, it will be hard for people to use it. To make it keyboard navigable, use semantic html tags and make sure that all interactive elements are accessible via the keyboard.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="code-card">
                <h3>5. Screen Reader Support</h3>
                <p>Screen readers are a tool that help people with visual impairments navigate the web. They read out loud the content of a website, and it's important to make sure that it's easy for screen readers to understand the content of a website, via ARIA tags and proper semantic html strucutre..</p>
